  fixed processing of stale interactions
    -- stale attributes must be deleted *before* stale interactions to avoid db constraint violations

  added processing of interactions from AGR (for all species processing)

ver 1.0.7  May 3, 2019
  turned on removal of stale interactions due to improvements in QC of incoming data
  refactored logic to be able to process data from multiple incoming files

ver 1.0.6  Apr 10, 2019
  tuned up processing logic
    incoming interactions are merged before loading for speedup and better reporting
    stale data processing runs only after all IMEX API requests complete successfully
  implemented download retrials

ver 1.0.5  Apr 9, 2019
  added Jami parser -- for testing mostly

  improved reporting of load stats for attributes

ver 1.0.1  May 24, 2017
  no longer invalid pubmed ids are loaded;
  15% of incoming references data had pubmed value like this: 'unassigned1304' which is totally uninformative;
    after consultation with Jennifer, these pubmed data will be filtered out by the pipeline;
  also stale interaction attributes (attributes that were not present in the incoming data) are deleted
