1) to speed up the pipeline:
   -process in parallel separate stages of processing
   -InteractionAttributesDAO.updateLastModifiedDate() takes up ~40% of total processing time
    optimize it by running updates in batches of 100
   -attrs: updateLastModifiedDate() was called 1,182,379 times,
    while there are only 842,623 rows in INTERACTION_ATTRIBUTES table;
    find out what is the source of duplicates
   -interactions: updateLastModifiedDate() was called 304,841 times,
    while there are only 192,512 rows in INTERACTIONS table;
    find out what is the source of duplicates
